# note - can also try "birthplace" to get something more mapable, but might have sparser results
# also some people will have more than one nationality result (e.g. Abraham Joshua Heschel)
# currently returns NULL if more than one nationality - want to do a check for dimensionality of
# the answer box first
# also add check for status of query and stop if bad
