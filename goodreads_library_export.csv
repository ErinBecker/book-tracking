By learning about the ideas behind the art styles, and the history surrounding how they developed, I've found that I can appreciate much more modern art.

The book is basically a framed narrative, where the bulk of the story is imaginative retellings of biblical narratives. Entertaining and at points laugh out loud funny. Parts were also very heart-warming. The book ended sooner than I expected - the last twenty pages or so are an appendix with some additional unrelated stories, some of which were pretty dark.

But I just couldn't. Sure, Leslie Meier is no Willie Collins or Dorothy L Sayers, but she's just so *real*. Even though her characters are two-dimensional, and her scenerios ridiculous (Tinker's Cove has a per capita death rate rivalling Chicago), Lucy Stone is just so realistic as a mother, wife, (and more recently grandmother) that I can't help identifying with her. This book makes a very interesting contrast, and a pleasant change of pace intellectually, to the classic manor house mysteries I've been reading. Meier puts the manor house, and its aristocratic family, firmly in the 21st century with a froo-froo ""prancer"" ballerina son, an Earl who cooks all the family dinners and drives a Range Rover, and a dismal financial situation that forces them to open their home to tourists to pay for repairs. A pleasant and relaxing read.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

This book presents a very different perspective than what you'll see in a lot of other books written by or about deaf folks. At the very least, it was certainly thought provoking. <br/><br/>One weakness is that the book is pretty dated in terms of technology. In the second half of the book, Kisor discusses a lot of technological ""advances"" that made communication easier for deaf folks, circa 1990. There is an updated epilogue that talks about more recent communication advances (texting, cell phones, chat rooms, video conferencing). <br/><br/>Another thing to watch out for is Kisor's discussion of the ADA. It has just been introduced as the book was going to press for its first edition and he was fairly negative about it, which was quite shocking and upsetting to me. I felt that his update about the ADA in the epilogue was more nuanced. <br/><br/>All in all a very worthwhile read.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

The author is obviously an expert on infant brain development and does a good job conveying that knowledge to a general audience. He also puts a big emphasis on evidence-based reasoning and is willing to admit when there isn't enough data to make a specific recommendation. This is refreshing.<br/><br/>Only a couple of criticisms:<br/><br/>1) In the chapter about sleep (new in the second edition), he mentions bed sharing as a valid option for infant/parent sleep arrangements without mentioning the APA's strong and unequivocal recommendations against bed-sharing. It's a simple fact - babies die. For an educated, scientifically-minded author of a child-rearing book not to spell out the dangers of this practice and provide the recommendations of the experts is irresponsible. (With apologies to my bed-sharing mommy friends. I still love you. A mommy's gotta do what a mommy's gotta do.)<br/><br/>2) The author raises the issue of post-partum depression (PPD) in the chapter on relationships but very briefly. Given the prevelance (10-20% of all new moms and also quite a few new dads), more information in the form of warning signs and resources would have been appreciated. In fact, I strongly feel that all books targeted towards new parents should provide this information. It's important. Might have saved me 6 months of soul-crushing misery.<br/><br/>3) The author is a strong proponent of breastfeeding. Ok. I'm not going to argue against the demonstrated benefits (although I have seen these called into question). But even if all of the research we're 100% established, we as a society (and especially people who have such a high level of influence over new parents) really need to acknowledge the fact that breastfeeding can be hard. In fact it can be hell. Breastfeeding difficulties are a common risk factor for developing PPD. So we need to recognize that the benefits don't always outweigh the risks (to the mother's mental health, physical health and safety and to infant-mother bonding). We need to support mom's in their decisions about how they feed their babies and not encourage shame and guilt about formula feeding. <br/><br/>All in all, a very good and useful book.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Heschel is routinely mentioned as one of the great Jewish philosophers of the 20th century and so I was excited to delve into this, one of his ""greatest works"". I could hardly have been more disappointed. <br/><br/>Heschel is a mystic and as such, eschews rationalist approaches to religion. Ok, sure. I'm willing to suspend my rationalism in that area for long enough to get through the book. The damning thing, however, is that Heschel gets sloppy about where exactly this anti-rationalism applies. Even if rationalism doesn't apply to the experience of religion, even if we can't describe God or judge a religious experience in the same way we would judge a scientific breakthrough, I still expect him to provide some sort of evidence for his historical claims. He consistently refuses to do this, and the book as a whole reads as 400+ pages of unsupported claims and wild leaps. Here are a few examples. <br/><br/>p. 223 ""Should we maintain that [the prophets] were mentally deranged, victims of hallucinations? . . . Their message being ages ahead of human thinking, it would be hard to believe in the normalcy of our own minds, if we questioned theirs. Indeed, if such is insanity, then we ought to feel ashamed of being sane... And granted, unlikely as it is, that signs of sickness should be traced in the life of the prophets. . . it would still be absurd to reject their claim. Is it not more meaningful to maintain that a person has to be sick in order to see what those who are benighted by their robustness and complacency fail to perceive?""<br/>Translation ""Even if the prophets were crazy, we still have to believe them. Perhaps its simply because we aren't crazy that we can't experience God directly.""<br/><br/>p. 229 ""What gave the prophets the certainty that they witnessed a divine event and not a figment of their own imagination? . . . A thunder out of a blue sky, a voice coming from nowhere, an effect without a visible cause, would not have been enough to identify a perception as a divine communication. . . [These] only manifest a force of nature, not God.""<br/>Here Heschel ignores the fact that until very recently in human history (in fact, until the rise of scientific knowledge) forces of nature were assume to be direct actions of God. If he wasn't so intent on assuming a modern framework for the Bible, this would be readily apparent. <br/><br/>And of course, leading questions play a large role in Heschel's rhetoric. . .<br/><br/>p. 240 ""Why does the Bible surpass everything created by man? Why is there no work worthy of comparison with it? Why is there no substitute for the Bible, no parallel to the history it has engendered? Why must all who seek the living God turn to its pages?"" <br/><br/>p. 247 ""To deny the divine origin of the Bible is to brand the entire history of the spiritual efforts and attainments in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam as the outgrowth of a colossal lie, the triumph of a deception which captured the finest souls for more than two thousand years."" <br/>Yeah, that's right, monotheists have the best souls. <br/><br/>p. 243 [The Bible] is the foutainhead of the finest strivings of man in the Western World. It has elicited more holiness and compassion from mankind than we are able to comprehend. Most of what is noble and just is derived from its spirit.""<br/>I'd say the Bible has inspired its fair share of events. The fact that Heschel can claim that those events are overwhelmingly good, however, simply showcases his blindness to history and reality. <br/><br/>I will finish this book, not because I find anything redeeming in it, but simply so that I can say I've read Heschel. I can only hope that my future explorations of Jewish intellectual history uncover something, well, intellectual. ",,,1,,,0,,,,,
