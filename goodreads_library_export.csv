I was worried I wouldn't enjoy this volume, as the main character, Daniel, had been a minor character in previous books and, to be honest, I thought he was annoying and petty. I was definitely wrong! <br/><br/>Although I enjoyed all three books, this one ended up being my favorite. Cole managed to portray characters who on the surface were either vacuous (Janeta) or antisocial (Daniel) in ways that were sympathetic and deeply moving. I truly appreciated Cole's portrayal of Daniel's mental anguish, and the complexity that she brought to the characters' inner lives. It's rare to find a sympathetic portrayal of mental illness in literature, particularly around trauma. Cole did this masterfully. <br/><br/><i>He often wondered how he'd been strong enough to survive the cruelties borne upon him, only to feel so weakened by the mere memory of them.</i><br/><br/><i>Daniel alone seemed unequal to the task of everyday living.</i><br/><br/>Daniel's reaction to and attitude towards the white man who purchases and then ""frees"" him is also novel, moving, and thought-provoking. <br/><br/><i>How could he truly be free if a white man could arbitrarily decide that for him?</i><br/><br/>And I love Cole's advice (through Janeta) about moving forward - <br/><br/><i>So I can't tell you to forgive yourself for what happened. I can't say that it's all right. . . The only thing we can do is try our best not to hurt others again. I think that is reasonable. And maybe not to treat ourselves worse than we would treat our enemies.</i><br/><br/>Thank you Alyssa Cole for this series and for dealing with hard, emotional questions head-on. I appreciate from your Afterword that this was a difficult book to write, and I'm glad you did. <br/><br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

I believe the collection comes from previously published volumes, but haven't seen any of these particular pieces before. There were 11 stories in all: <br/>- Laudromarceline - a cute short story about Marceline helping Finn and Jake with some laundry<br/>- Resurrection Song - short, dark tale about Marceline's dead dog. :-(<br/>- Grumpy Butt - short, funny one about Marceline and Princess Bubblegum's trip to the land of Bloo, where everything is blue and Marceline get's hangry.<br/>- Bad Girl Gone Good - Marceline ironically dresses up as a nice girl for Halloween but is annoyed that everyone is being nice to her and doesn't realize she's being sarcastic. <br/>- The Moon: Eclipse - Longer piece with elements of an origin story and some flashbacks. I didn't really get this one.<br/>- Marceline and the Scream Queens - by far the longest piece. PBG becomes The Scream Queens' manager as the band goes on tour. We learn about Marceline's relationship to her musical career. <br/>- Eclipse - super sweet short about an unfinished song. <br/>- Moonbeam - another sweet short one about a song. <br/>- Broken - Marceline's childhood with Simon. My favorite piece in the collection. Interestingly different art style too. Very classical comic. <br/>- Visions of Paternity - dark nightmare. <br/>- Marceline the Derby Queen - sweet short about the relationship between Marceline and Simon. Funny, lighthearted end to the collection. <br/><br/>I really enjoyed most of these, so giving it a solid 4 starts. Looking forward to reading the other character collections. ",,,1,,,0,,,,,

The Binti series isn't available through my library's e-loan system, but this series was so I jumped at the opportunity, even though I hadn't heard anything about this series specifically. I happened to read this right after Children of Blood and Bone (also YA, also by a Nigerian-American author, also set in a magicalized (nominal) Nigeria) and this was by far the superior work, from a stylistic perspective. Although it was classed as YA, Akata Witch managed to avoid all of the YA tropes. There wasn't an annoying love triangle or ""forbidden romance"" - the romance element was there, but it was minimal. The main character wasn't magically all powerful - each of the characters had significant strengths and weaknesses that played really well together. And it didn't constantly over-explain the action. Often when reading YA I feel like I'm being bludgeoned over the head with explanation, when I understood what was happening the first five times, thanks. This book avoided that trap.<br/><br/>So much for what it (thankfully) wasn't. What about what it was? This is the first in a series following a group of four pre-teen friends as they learn their magical craft. The main character, Sunny, an albino American-Nigerian girl, was born into a non-magical family and is only now learning of the existence of the magical world, at the same time as discovering her gifts. The four friends read magical instruction books, purchase magical items, and complete dangerous tasks, all while learning valuable lessons about teamwork and about the rules of the magical world. Oh, and there's also a magical serial killer running around in the background. Some of these elements may sound familiar, but this was far from an Africanized Harry Potter. The magical world was new and inventive, and the attitudes of the adults supervising the magical instruction of these four children was refreshingly novel. Unlike in many YA universes, where the purpose of the adult characters is to protect the children (thereby incidentally preventing them from realizing the full potential of their powers), in Sunny's world, the adults are pragmatic about the danger that their children face, routinely placing them in dangerous situations for the sake of learning. <br/><br/>One of the four friends is an American boy, who was ousted from his home magical society for troublemaking, and his presence in the book serves as a thought-provoking reflection on Sunny's identity. Is she Nigerian? Is she American? She's an outsider in the group in other ways, being the only one who wasn't raised as part of the magical world, a tomboy (she plays soccer), and an albino. The question of identity and belonging wasn't heavily emphasized, but there were passages where Okorafor seemed to be hinting at a broader theme that might be developed further in subsequent books. I'm very much looking forward to the sequel!",,,1,,,0,,,,,

First off, if you're going to put a hot air balloon on the cover, I expect it to survive longer than two pages. That aside - I read this book simultaneously with We Cast A Shadow (Maurice Carlos Ruffin). Very different settings (1840s vs near-future dystopia), but to me, both works explore the duality of intention vs impact - the ability to (mis)see yourself as the hero in your own life story. In this book, the main character (""Wash"" for short), is ""rescued"" from a cruel master by his abolishionist brother ""Titch"". Titch takes Wash away from hard labor in the cane fields and makes him his scientific apprentice - teaching him how to read and draw. Titch obviously sees himself as Wash's savior - never bothering to question the harm he may be doing by taking Wash away from his only friend and isolating him, teaching him a skill that could endanger his life, or reflecting on the fact that he has denied Wash any agency in his own life choices. <br/><br/>Titch does help Wash escape the plantation, but then abandons him (in the Arctic). Wash, suddenly on his own (and disfigured from one of Titch's experiments), makes a life for himself doing odd jobs. When he hears a rumour that Titch is alive, he drops everything and searches for him across several continents. When he finally finds Titch, he learns that Titch holds no regret for abandoning him, or for using him, believing that he treated him ""like family"". In the end, Wash walks out alone into a sandstorm, abandoning his lover in remote Moracco. <br/><br/>I didn't get the ending, really. I feel like the author could have done a better job building the relationship between Wash and Titch so that the ""reveal"" was more shocking. The message didn't really hit home with me, because it was so obvious Titch was full of shit. Maybe if he had realized his shitiness at the end? Or maybe I completely missed the point of the book and it wasn't about exploding the great white savior myth. I wish I was more confident about the author's point.<br/><br/>There was a lot of undeveloped potential here. The blurb promised action and adventure, but it wasn't delivered convincingly (Wash travels broadly, but it's always presented as ""and then he went to X"", with no narrative exposition on the journey).

It's about as much sci-fi as The Time Traveler's Wife (which I also very much enjoyed).<br/><br/>2) I was really hoping for more exploration of the impact of living among slavery would have on the books's main white character. There were some hints that Butler was going to dive into it, but it wasn't ever developed.<br/><br/>Despite these two minor imperfections, I really enjoyed this book. I particularly enjoyed how *smart* the characters were about time traveling (eg immediately after the second episode, the main character starts keeping supplies on her person at all times). I'm looking forward to reading more of Butler's work, especially Dawn, which looks like much more ""heavy"" sci-fi.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Heschel is routinely mentioned as one of the great Jewish philosophers of the 20th century and so I was excited to delve into this, one of his ""greatest works"". I could hardly have been more disappointed. <br/><br/>Heschel is a mystic and as such, eschews rationalist approaches to religion. Ok, sure. I'm willing to suspend my rationalism in that area for long enough to get through the book. The damning thing, however, is that Heschel gets sloppy about where exactly this anti-rationalism applies. Even if rationalism doesn't apply to the experience of religion, even if we can't describe God or judge a religious experience in the same way we would judge a scientific breakthrough, I still expect him to provide some sort of evidence for his historical claims. He consistently refuses to do this, and the book as a whole reads as 400+ pages of unsupported claims and wild leaps. Here are a few examples. <br/><br/>p. 223 ""Should we maintain that [the prophets] were mentally deranged, victims of hallucinations? . . . Their message being ages ahead of human thinking, it would be hard to believe in the normalcy of our own minds, if we questioned theirs. Indeed, if such is insanity, then we ought to feel ashamed of being sane... And granted, unlikely as it is, that signs of sickness should be traced in the life of the prophets. . . it would still be absurd to reject their claim. Is it not more meaningful to maintain that a person has to be sick in order to see what those who are benighted by their robustness and complacency fail to perceive?""<br/>Translation ""Even if the prophets were crazy, we still have to believe them. Perhaps its simply because we aren't crazy that we can't experience God directly.""<br/><br/>p. 229 ""What gave the prophets the certainty that they witnessed a divine event and not a figment of their own imagination? . . . A thunder out of a blue sky, a voice coming from nowhere, an effect without a visible cause, would not have been enough to identify a perception as a divine communication. . . [These] only manifest a force of nature, not God.""<br/>Here Heschel ignores the fact that until very recently in human history (in fact, until the rise of scientific knowledge) forces of nature were assume to be direct actions of God. If he wasn't so intent on assuming a modern framework for the Bible, this would be readily apparent. <br/><br/>And of course, leading questions play a large role in Heschel's rhetoric. . .<br/><br/>p. 240 ""Why does the Bible surpass everything created by man? Why is there no work worthy of comparison with it? Why is there no substitute for the Bible, no parallel to the history it has engendered? Why must all who seek the living God turn to its pages?"" <br/><br/>p. 247 ""To deny the divine origin of the Bible is to brand the entire history of the spiritual efforts and attainments in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam as the outgrowth of a colossal lie, the triumph of a deception which captured the finest souls for more than two thousand years."" <br/>Yeah, that's right, monotheists have the best souls. <br/><br/>p. 243 [The Bible] is the foutainhead of the finest strivings of man in the Western World. It has elicited more holiness and compassion from mankind than we are able to comprehend. Most of what is noble and just is derived from its spirit.""<br/>I'd say the Bible has inspired its fair share of events. The fact that Heschel can claim that those events are overwhelmingly good, however, simply showcases his blindness to history and reality. <br/><br/>I will finish this book, not because I find anything redeeming in it, but simply so that I can say I've read Heschel. I can only hope that my future explorations of Jewish intellectual history uncover something, well, intellectual. ",,,1,,,0,,,,,

By learning about the ideas behind the art styles, and the history surrounding how they developed, I've found that I can appreciate much more modern art.

But I just couldn't. Sure, Leslie Meier is no Willie Collins or Dorothy L Sayers, but she's just so *real*. Even though her characters are two-dimensional, and her scenerios ridiculous (Tinker's Cove has a per capita death rate rivalling Chicago), Lucy Stone is just so realistic as a mother, wife, (and more recently grandmother) that I can't help identifying with her. This book makes a very interesting contrast, and a pleasant change of pace intellectually, to the classic manor house mysteries I've been reading. Meier puts the manor house, and its aristocratic family, firmly in the 21st century with a froo-froo ""prancer"" ballerina son, an Earl who cooks all the family dinners and drives a Range Rover, and a dismal financial situation that forces them to open their home to tourists to pay for repairs.

This book presents a very different perspective than what you'll see in a lot of other books written by or about deaf folks. At the very least, it was certainly thought provoking. <br/><br/>One weakness is that the book is pretty dated in terms of technology. In the second half of the book, Kisor discusses a lot of technological ""advances"" that made communication easier for deaf folks, circa 1990. There is an updated epilogue that talks about more recent communication advances (texting, cell phones, chat rooms, video conferencing). <br/><br/>Another thing to watch out for is Kisor's discussion of the ADA. It has just been introduced as the book was going to press for its first edition and he was fairly negative about it, which was quite shocking and upsetting to me. I felt that his update about the ADA in the epilogue was more nuanced. <br/><br/>All in all a very worthwhile read.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

The author is obviously an expert on infant brain development and does a good job conveying that knowledge to a general audience. He also puts a big emphasis on evidence-based reasoning and is willing to admit when there isn't enough data to make a specific recommendation. This is refreshing.<br/><br/>Only a couple of criticisms:<br/><br/>1) In the chapter about sleep (new in the second edition), he mentions bed sharing as a valid option for infant/parent sleep arrangements without mentioning the APA's strong and unequivocal recommendations against bed-sharing. It's a simple fact - babies die. For an educated, scientifically-minded author of a child-rearing book not to spell out the dangers of this practice and provide the recommendations of the experts is irresponsible. (With apologies to my bed-sharing mommy friends. I still love you. A mommy's gotta do what a mommy's gotta do.)<br/><br/>2) The author raises the issue of post-partum depression (PPD) in the chapter on relationships but very briefly. Given the prevelance (10-20% of all new moms and also quite a few new dads), more information in the form of warning signs and resources would have been appreciated. In fact, I strongly feel that all books targeted towards new parents should provide this information. It's important. Might have saved me 6 months of soul-crushing misery.<br/><br/>3) The author is a strong proponent of breastfeeding. Ok. I'm not going to argue against the demonstrated benefits (although I have seen these called into question). But even if all of the research we're 100% established, we as a society (and especially people who have such a high level of influence over new parents) really need to acknowledge the fact that breastfeeding can be hard. In fact it can be hell. Breastfeeding difficulties are a common risk factor for developing PPD. So we need to recognize that the benefits don't always outweigh the risks (to the mother's mental health, physical health and safety and to infant-mother bonding). We need to support mom's in their decisions about how they feed their babies and not encourage shame and guilt about formula feeding. <br/><br/>All in all, a very good and useful book.",,,1,,,0,,,,,
